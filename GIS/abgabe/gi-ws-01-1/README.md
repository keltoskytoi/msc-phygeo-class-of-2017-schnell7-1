The folder https://github.com/logmoc/msc-phygeo-class-of-2017-lgiese/tree/master/gis contains all scripts developped by Laura Giese, Johannes Schnell and Alena Schmid in gis class gi-ws17/18 at Marburg University/MSc Physical Geography.

Deriving canopy Height Model (CHM), Foliage Hieght Diversity Index (FHD) and Vertical Distribution Ratio Index (VDR)
are calculated to examine forest structure
These task is done step by step in files of folders: gi-ws-01-1 until gi-ws-07-1.

In folder gi-ws-08-1 we were deriving Clearings in Caldern forest.

In folders gi-ws-09-1 until gi-ws-11-1 we detected single trees in Caldern forest.

The folder "functions" contains the most important functions created during the course and the .rmd file explains in which order to use them.
